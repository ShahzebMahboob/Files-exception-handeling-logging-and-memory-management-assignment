    "#Q1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages.\n",

    "# How it works: Code is translated and executed line-by-line at runtime using an interpreter.\n",
    "# Output: No separate executable; the interpreter runs the source directly.\n",

    "# Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.\n",

    "#* Compiled Languages:-\n",
    "# How it works: The entire program is translated into machine code before execution using a compiler.\n",
